# Image_Processing_C
Implementation of basic image processing algorithms in C without using external libraries. The images used are Bitmap images.
Basic Implementation of :
Color to Greyscale
Applying Gaussian Blur
Apply Sobble Filter
Apply Canny Operator
Apply Hysterisis Thresholding
Generate Patches
Identify Important patches

#Some Details

Greyscale algorithm used is lightness.
Gaussian blur convolution kernel size can be changed( works best with 3 though).
Sobble operator returns matrix with Canny and Hys_thres already applied.
Patch Identification may not generate complete patches sometimes.
